Components:
- react-dom
--> takes you html and binds it to react
-- very small: only glues react code to the dom
-- for instance if using react-native you dont need react-dom
- babel
--> for transpiling ES6 to ES5
-- not all browsers read new ES6 thats why we need this
- webpack
--> runs babel tasks for us
-- executes bundle scripts
- superagent
--> handles API requests
